# ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed Test (Tkinter App)

**Typing Speed Test** is a GUI-based Python application built with **Tkinter** that allows users to measure their typing speed in **WPM (Words Per Minute)** and **CPM (Characters Per Minute)**. The app also highlights mistakes, tracks high scores, and allows restarting the test with a click!

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RohitKumarChaudhari/typing-speed-test.git
    cd typing-speed-test
    ```
2. Run the app
   ```bash

   ```
   
## üß† How It Works

- A list of random words is shown on the screen.
- The user types in the input box, and the app compares typed words.
- After time runs out, it shows WPM/CPM, mistakes, and lets you restart or exit.

## üôè Inspiration

This app was inspired by the online typing test at [typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu](https://typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu/?lang=en).  
I recreated a similar experience using Python and Tkinter for learning and practice purposes.
